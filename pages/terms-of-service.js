        Iris helps you discover and share what you love. To do that, we show you
        things we think will be relevant, interesting and personal to you based
        on your onsite and offsite activity. To provide our Service, we need to
        be able to identify you and your interests. Some of the things we show
        you are promoted by advertisers. As part of our service we try to ensure
        that even promoted content is relevant and interesting to you. You can
        identify promoted content because it will be clearly labeled.

"/>
      <Term text="8. Indemnity"/>
      <Term text="If you use Iris for commercial purposes (i.e., you are not a consumer) without agreeing to our Business Terms as required by Section 2(c) of these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Iris, their affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to your access to or use of our Service, your User Content, or your breach of any of these Terms."/>
      <Term text="9. Disclaimers"/>
      <Term text="Our Service and all content on Iris is provided on an &apos;as is&apos; basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied."/>
      <Term text="Iris specifically disclaims any and all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade."/>
      <Term text="Iris takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other person or third party posts or sends using our Service. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that’s inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose."/>
      <Term text="If you're a consumer in the EEA, we don’t exclude or limit any liability for gross negligence, intent, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct. "/>
      <Term text=" 10. Limitation of liability"/>
      <Term className="uppercase" text="TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IRIS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL IRIS'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00)."/>
      <Term text="If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn’t apply. Instead, Iris’s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Iris isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won’t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you."/>
      <Term text="11. Arbitration"/>
      <Term text="For any dispute you have with Iris, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address on your Iris account. If Iris hasn’t been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court."/>
      <Term text="Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Iris are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Iris account."/>
      <Term text="Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association  under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. You can find their forms at www.adr.org . Unless you and Iris agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that Iris will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. "/>
      <Term text="No waiver"/>
      <Term text="No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Iris's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision."/>
      <Term text="Parties"/>
      <Term text="These Terms are a contract between you and QP VENTURES, INC. dba NEWNESS, 77 Van Ness Ave STE 101-1633 San Francisco, CA 94102."/>
